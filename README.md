# Startup Sprint

This is a partially finished app with a ton of work left in the backlog. It's up to you and your teammates to generate as much velocity as you can!

## Overview

We're building an app for today's sprint, complete with a schedule page, team page, newsletter signup form, and other supporting features. Complete as much as you can, then deploy your app to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home).

The backlog is here in this [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/gK1QntcZ).

From the menu on the right, copy the Trello board to one of your own. Then start looking through the cards and picking out the ones that seem most cost effective to implement for your team.

## Getting Started

Fork and clone this lab. You'll probably want to add your teammates as collaborators on your Github repo so that you can collaborate. Watch out for merge conflicts though!

You'll need to run `bundle install` to install all the necessary Ruby gems.

Start the server with the `rackup` command, you can then view it at "http://localhost:9292".

## Recommended Workflow

As you work through the backlog, assign tickets to one or more team members, who will own completing the ticket.

You'll want to create a new git branch for each ticket, and do your work on that branch.

Submit a separate pull request for each ticket, and be sure to link your pull request to the ticket for easy reference.

Review each other's work before merging :shipit:
